# planning

- realized that I'm over-focusing on auth too early. probably should just deploy the realtime sync functionality without auth and implement that after. 
- using a new chat and multiple models to validate the plan worked well. used opus 4.1, sonnet 4.5, and chatgpt gpt5 heavy thinking and they had a general consensus about what needed to be fixed
- asking questions about the plan as I went used a lot of context in the same thread. consider using chatgpt if possible for branching off and asking questions without exploding the main context window for tight planning and better performance
- general observation: im spending like 6+ hours planning for the mvp. this feels like way too much. probably need to be way more aggressive about cutting scope and accepting technical debt for non-core features early. need to do the hard things first.
