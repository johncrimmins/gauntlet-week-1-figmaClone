# new PR's
# this one worked pretty well for a basic PR - it identified where it's at and built from there. However it does sometimes tend to get on a roll after completing one or two tasks and just start steamrolling through tasks and not anything that's complete by itself. Just steamrolled through all the tasks in PR4 - Let's see if it did them correctly.
Please use tools to explore the codebase and pay special attention to the slash docs folder. I then want you to review the tasklist.md file and let's start building out our next PR. To do this, I want you to please ensure that you're following tasks one at a time and I'm approving them one by one as we go. Do not move on to other tasks or other PRs or edit anything except for the tasks that are specified under our current PR. Please verify the PR that we're working on by reading the document and letting me know which one we're working on. This is very important. Please never move on to another task except the one that we are working on until I have approved it and you let me know what to look at to validate that it's working. And then after my approval, go ahead and mark the task as completed. Create a plan for how to implement the next task which needs to be done.


# best for new PR's so far - way more specific and concise. Interestingly, on PR5 it created its own plan for implementation when I used the Plan mode (didnt follow the tasklist). Great results on PR5 though. On PR6, I used Agent mode and it just followed the tasklist plan.   
Please use tools to explore the codebase. Review @tasklist.md file and identify what PR to build. Create a plan to implement the that PR. Very important: Do not work on any tasks outside the current PR. Also very important: double check code implemented to ensure implementation is complete and bug-free. When you're done, provide instructions for user to validate your work according to the current PR's **Definition of Done section:** section. The user will thoroughly test your implementation to verify correct implementation.
